i'm layla! a a Software Engineering major, and aspiring Full Stack Developer. i'm an intense animal lover, and will stop to pet any and all doggos if their owners will let me ðŸ˜¹ 

### a ~~byte~~ bit more info about me:
i grew up playing soccer from 3 years old to 11 years old, then i switched to volleyball. which i then played until i was 18 years old. now being older, i'm determined to become a pilates instructor in my free time! my motto is 'fit body === fit mind'. as far as computers & coding goes, when i was younger i'd use css to customize my own myspace page, as well as blogging on wordpress daily about Club Penguin (lol i know). to my amusement, my childhood blog had amassed around 29K views while i was 12/13 years old. ðŸ¤£ 

### what you can expect from this blog:

i'm going to be blogging about my personal coding journey, 'how-to' posts about certain languages, frameworks & concepts, posting my cheatsheets here, + more. feel free to comment on any of my blog posts + (respectfully) leave any kind of constructive criticism.
