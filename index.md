i'm layla! a a Software Engineering major, and aspiring Full Stack Developer. i'm an intense animal lover, and will stop to pet any and all doggos if their owners will let me ðŸ˜¹ 

### a ~~byte~~ bit more info about me:
i'm extremely into fitness, hiking + working out. my motto is 'fit body === fit mind' ðŸ§¡ at a young age, i started developing a passion for sports, as well as computers, blogging and coding. at around 11/12, i was juggling learning how to code in css on my myspace page & practicing volleyball 3/4 times a week to land myself a college scholarship. as i grew older, i quickly realized i did not want to go to college for sports. i then went on to major in Business Administration my freshman year of college...only to change my major a year & a half later to Software Engineering. 
i ended up breaking my wrist in 2019 due to a bad car wreck, and required surgey to insert some screws, so i ended up taking off almost 2 full semesters due to that. which was a bummer, but i'm on my own journey. and i don't compare myself to anybody else! our journeys are uniquely each our own. embrace it.

### what you can expect from this blog:

i'm going to be blogging about my personal coding journey, 'how-to' posts about certain languages, frameworks & concepts, posting my cheatsheets here, + more. feel free to comment on any of my blog posts + (respectfully) leave any kind of constructive criticism. 

connect with me on my socials at the bottom - thanks for visiting ðŸ§¡
